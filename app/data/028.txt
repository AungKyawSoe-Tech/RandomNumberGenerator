Guan Yin Lot 28
Medium

Lot Verse:
The moon rises in the east, so gracefully and beautifully. 

Not visible, but still there. 

It goes down, rises, and fills up again. 

Gossips still talk about things that aren’t true.

The Meaning:
The moon is hidden by clouds, making everything look dark and uneasy. The cloud that hides the moon is only there for a short time, so don’t be afraid or back away. It won’t last long. Once the clouds clear, it will be easy to see and move forward.

Celestial Message:
There is a lot of worry at home, but you can pray for your own safety. Even though business deals look good, there will be problems along the way. Arrangements to get married won’t work, and getting pregnant will be dangerous. Farming and the silk business are both having a bad year. Travelers will have trouble, and those who go missing won’t be found. You can find lost things in the west. Lawsuits are negative. It’s not a good idea to move or change jobs. The sick can’t get better, and for safety, you should move the bones of your ancestors.
