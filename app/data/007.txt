Guan Yin Lot 07
Bad sign, big things cannot happen.

Lot Verse:
The path ahead is obstructed and dangerous.

The ground is being dragged to the mountains by the waves.

If you want to work in another country,

You will not locate any; instead, return home.

The Meaning:
A boat is being pushed and pulled through dirty water in this scene. You have to stay still and not move. Since no progress can be made, it will be necessary to pull back and retire. Just leave things alone. If you don’t try to do anything big, you won’t fail.

Celestial Message:
Things look bad with your family, and you should pray for your own safety. There are enough chances to do business. You can only get rich in the fall and winter. You should pray for God’s blessing on your marriage and your child. It is not a good year to raise horses or make silk. Travelers will be late, and those who go missing won’t be found. Lost things can never be found again. Lawsuits are negative. It is suggested to move. Prayer is the only way to heal sickness. It is not a good year for the graves of your ancestors.
