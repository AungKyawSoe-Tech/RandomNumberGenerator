Guan Yin Lot 34
Medium

Lot Verse:
Always act with grace and modesty. 

What you say and how you act are both genuine. 

If you have any lingering uncertainties. 

Walk tall and proud, just like the sun’s beams.

The Meaning:
 The crimson sun is centered in the sky. It means that anything you want for will come true. Your mind and spirit should be as clear and calm as the river in the fall. If problems can be solved easily, there’s no need in worrying about them.

Celestial Message:
You and your loved ones are in no danger at all. Profitability is severely disrupted by unforeseen issues. The pairing process will be fruitful, but the pregnancy might have complications. It’s not worthwhile to engage in farming, the silk trade, or cattle keeping. There is little possibility of discovering the missing, and travelers risk encountering difficulties along the way. Stop wasting time trying to locate misplaced items. It’s not a good idea to relocate or make any legal changes that might put you at risk of losing. Only by praying away the devil may those who are ill be restored to health. Your family’s burial grounds are safe from damage.
