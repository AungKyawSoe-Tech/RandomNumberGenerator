Guan Yin Lot 48
Medium

Lot Verse:
In the fall, a bird of prey turns into a roc. 

No other bird has this much freedom. 

It keeps going up and up in the sky. 

During his flight, he goes over miles of clouds.

The Meaning:
 This lot depicts a very unusual situation in which a partridge is turned into a roc, a massive bird referenced in ancient mythology. A notice like this indicates that a significant shift is about to occur. A partridge transforming into a roc is an extremely unusual occurrence, particularly for a game bird. Take only one limb from a cassia tree, and your prosperity and happiness will continue to expand.

Celestial Message:
Peace and safety will come to you and your family. Deals will take longer to close, but you have a good chance of making money in the fall. Matchmaking doesn’t work, but your wife will have a safe baby if you get married. Farming and raising silkworms won’t bring in much money, and spring is the only good time to raise animals. Your friend will be late, but those who have gone missing will be found. Only in the west can lost things be found. If you go to law school, you will win. Moving to a new place is not a good idea. Through prayer, sick people will get better. The graves of your ancestors are safe.
