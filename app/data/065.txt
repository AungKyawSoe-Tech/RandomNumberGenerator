Guan Yin Lot 65
Bad

Lot Verse:
What you see in front of you 

May or may not be dangerous or safe.

Cutting one’s own flesh to heal one’s wound is stupid; 

Better to stay and wait for the time to pass.

The Meaning:
In this scenario, a dumb guy attempts to patch up his wound by cutting his own flesh. As a direct consequence of this, he brings even greater suffering upon himself. 

Celestial Message:
It is not safe for your family. Be careful what you say since even the slightest slip of the tongue may get you into a world of trouble. Making money is not a hopeful prospect, and rogues and criminals will destroy your company if you let them. The marriage will not stand the test of time. When giving birth, the expectant woman will experience agony as well as potential risk. Travelers will experience delays, and efforts to locate those who have gone missing will be fraught with complications. Farming, raising silkworms, and animals will all result in a loss of money for you. You will not prevail in legal battles. You have nothing to gain by moving, so you may as well keep your current position. When looking for objects that have been lost, you will run across challenges. It is not possible to entirely recover from illness.
