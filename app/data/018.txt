Guan Yin Lot Divination 18 (Kuan Yin Lot 18)
Good

Lot Verse:
The sun sets as the moon rises in the distance. 

Believe in Buddha and the Tao, 

Everything is knowledge. 

Scholar, peasant, laborer, and trader.

The Meaning:
The sun and moon coming up and going down are like the ups and downs of life. When the sun and moon are in sync, it means that things are going well. Stay calm in your heart; you can get what you want. But once it leaves the bow, a dart can cut all the way through.  

Celestial Message:
Both you and your house will be safe. Your business will go well and make you good money. You can talk about getting married, and you’ll have a son. You should start growing and raising silkworms as soon as possible, but it won’t be worth it to raise cattle. Both the tourist and the lost man will arrive safely. Things that were lost will turn up at the end of the year. Cases will go in your favor, and it’s a good idea to move or migrate. Those who are sick should build an altar and pray to get rid of the bad spirits. The graves of the dead will be blessed.
