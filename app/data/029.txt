The person youâ€™re expecting to come over will be a little late, but the person who went missing will be found. Things that were lost will come back to the south. Disputes will be solved peacefully because of kindness. If you move to a different country, you will be successful. This person will get better. The outlook for graves and tombs of ancestors continues good.
