Guan Yin Lot 74
Bad

Lot Verse:
Like a flock of snow geese that walks into a cage without looking,

No matter how hard it tries, it can’t be free.

Every way is blocked—north, south, east, and west.

This Lot foretells an endless sorrow.

The Meaning:
 A snow goose jumps into a pond in this scene. So things don’t work out and aren’t real or true.

Celestial Message:
Your home is dangerous, and you are in a tough position. You have fierce competitors who want to hurt your business. You will lose a great deal of money. When a marriage breaks up, it hurts and torments people physically, and being pregnant doesn’t lead to any babies. You won’t be able to farm or grow silkworms, and your animals will get sick and get hurt. People who are gone will never come back, and visitors will have to wait. It’s not a good idea to go to court over a disagreement. It’s not a good idea to move. You have no chance of getting back what you’ve lost. Sickness will last longer, and graves of ancestors may be destroyed.
