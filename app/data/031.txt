Lot Verse:
Your life will be easy and peaceful. 

You won’t have anything to worry about. 

Sit back and take a sip of tea when the metal is done.

Be sure that nothing bad will happen.

The Meaning:
You are told to take it easy, stay cool, and not worry about making changes. If you are patient, everything will work out well. Stay calm and free of worry. You might as well ask fairies for help. Having patience and being tolerant will do wonders for you. Nothing can be done until the right time. 

Celestial Message:
You have to pray to God to take care of your family, but you won’t be in any danger. Later in the year, business is better. There is no chance of getting a lot of money, so all you can do is be patient. Matchmaking is looking good, and the mother will have a girl. Cattle raising will be safe and profitable, and you can expect a good supply of silkworms in the fall. The person you’re expecting will show up at some point, but the lost person is harder to find. There’s no chance of finding lost things. Cases will be solved by settlement. Things are looking good for migration. Set up an altar to get rid of the devil and heal the sick. There will be blessings on the graves of your ancestors.
