Guan Yin Lot 50
Medium

Lot Verse:
Born on a trip across the vast ocean. 

Sails that are up high start to billow and pull. 

With waves pushing the ship forward. 

You will get big boxes full of jewels and wealth.

The Meaning:
This lot talks about a ship moving with the wind in its favor. It means that everything will work out well in the end. You have an easy and comfortable life. You won’t have to do much to get what you want. As a result, a big fort is all yours. People will talk, which will make them jealous.

Celestial Message:
You and your family will feel protected and secure. Business is best done later in the year, and you should hunt for money and success towards the west. The match will not be formalized, but the pregnancy will be safe. Autumn is the best time for silk and grain crops, while spring is the best time for cattle. Travelers will encounter hardships, but the lost will be found. In the west, lost items may be tracked down and recovered. Lawsuits will be filed against you, and relocation is not suggested. The illness will be resolved. Fortune lives in the southern section of your ancestors’ tombs.
