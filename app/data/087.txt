Guan Yin Lot 87
Medium

Lot Verse:
The sun sets halfway up the mountains.

Dangerously trapped amid rocky cliffs, 

One turns above for safety, 

And earthly sanctuary will soon be delivered.

The Meaning:
In this scene, a man sorts through and washes the sand, and then he finds gold. It is a good sign, which means that a powerful man is always on your side.

Celestial Message:
Your family is not safe, and the only way you can keep yourself safe is to pray. If you try to make money, you will waste time and effort. You should always be careful with money. There will be problems with your marriage, and your wife won’t be able to get pregnant. Normal drops of grains and silk will happen, and you can’t make money from animals. The guest will show up late. There is no way to find the people who are gone or the things that have been lost. People will sue you and win. Don’t think about changing. Stay where you are. The sick are not cured by medical care. There won’t be any trouble for graves of ancestors.
