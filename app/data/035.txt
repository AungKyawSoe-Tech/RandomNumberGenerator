Guan Yin Lot 35
Medium

Lot Verse:
Please readjust your caps and outerwear. 

Bring back the once-proud family name. 

Clear the path of obstacles, such as thorns and thistles. 

When compromise is achieved, you will be rewarded handsomely.

The Meaning:
This lot talks about how people dress up in expensive, formal clothes to add the family’s name. Before your dreams can be granted, you have to go through hard times. Doubts and fears don’t get you anywhere, so you’d be better off waiting for your good day. Be brave and start your trip, because it will lead to more opportunities.

Celestial Message:
Your home will be chaotic, but you will be safe. When business deals go well, good gains are made. There will be problems in marriage, and there will be danger for women who are pregnant. Farming and raising silkworms won’t make you much money, but having animals will. Soon, people will start coming, and those who are lost will be found. Things that were lost will show up again late in the year. Suits will be successful. Migration is a good thing, and God’s gift can heal sickness. If you leave the graves of your ancestors alone, the family will gain.
