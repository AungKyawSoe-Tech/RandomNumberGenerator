Guan Yin Lot 61

Lot Verse:
Read poems during the day and sing songs at night. 

Have fun and laugh with others at these events.

This kind of partying is rare and hard to hide, 

So let’s sing our hearts out like a nice couple would like.

The Meaning:
This depicts a scene of festivities on festival days, and it advises you to make the most of possibilities and chances when they present themselves.

Celestial Message:
You and your family will have serenity and safety. Business will be robust, and profits will be high. You will enjoy a happy marriage, and your wife will have a daughter. The anticipated guest will come shortly, and the missing will be discovered. Grain, silk, and cattle will do well this year. You will prevail in court. Moving to a different location is advised, but there is no possibility of recovering lost items. The sick will be healed quickly, and your ancestors’ graves will be blessed.
