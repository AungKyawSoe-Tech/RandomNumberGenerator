Guan Yin Lot 57
Medium

Lot Verse:
Let gossip and scandals blow past your ears

for a life of nice clothing and riches.

I’m sure you’ll agree

Let the past go.

The Meaning:
You’ll have people on your side, just as when the kid saw mom, and your plans will succeed. Your plans will not only benefit you, but the others around you as well.  Put forth time and effort for the common good with the care and concern of a mother for her child.

Celestial Message:
You are safe, but your family is in danger. You will make money when you trade. The marriage will work out, but there will only be a girl. People won’t be able to get where they need to go. Both gardening and making silk will make money, but the animals will be hurt. Those who are lost won’t be found. Disputes should be solved by talking things out. Lawsuits are not recommended. Better not move, because moving doesn’t bring good luck. Lost things will never be found again. The sick can only be helped by prayers. A good year for the graves of the dead.
