Guan Yin Lot 79
Medium

Lot Verse:
In return for security, a fake promise is made. 

You are safe, but the promise is not kept.

Heaven’s favor should be paid back and not forgotten. 

You shouldn’t be so careless with God.

The Meaning:
 This lot tells you to aim for things that are real and useful, so if you try to reach for goals that don’t mean anything, you will fail.

Celestial Message:
You have to make a promise to God if you want him to protect you and your family. There aren’t many chances to make money. You must do your job well and be careful when doing business. The marriage won’t work, and there will only be a girl. People will have to wait longer, and there is no news about those who went missing. There will only be a 70% harvest from farming and silkworms, and it’s not a good time to raise animals. Mediation is the best way to settle disagreements. People tell you not to move. Things that were lost will turn up in the west. The sick will get better, and the graves of ancestors should face west.
