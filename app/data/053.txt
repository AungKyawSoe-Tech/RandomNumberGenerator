Guan Yin Lot 53
Medium

Lot Verse:
When sadness turns into happiness,

The dragon’s song and the tiger’s roar will mix together.

The clear blue sky is cut through by a highway,

It’s time to start getting known again.

The Meaning:
There is optimism that everything will go as planned when the dragon beckons or the tiger roars.

Allow what needs to leave and retain what needs to be maintained.  You will learn and integrate everything you need to construct your own road to success if you follow what is predestined.

Celestial Message:
Your family and you is unsafe. Trading is neither simple or rich. Pray for your wife’s pregnancy. The visitor is due shortly. Your silk, grain, and cattle will suffer. This missing will return and litigation will settle quietly. The lost and sick will recover. Ancestral tombs will have luck.
