Guan Yin Lot 80
Good

Lot Verse:
On your way to the mountains to learn spiritual ways, 

The King stops you and calls you.

When the sky is clear, the Sun and the Moon shine on you. 

Your good heart and name have spread across the seven seas.

The Meaning:
This tells you to expect a scene in which a powerful and well-known man shows you the way. It shows that everything is working well together. 

Celestial Message:
Your family and you are safe. There will be a lot of money made from business deals. Things work out well with the marriage plans, and a boy will be born. People will come back on time, and those who are lost will be found. Things that were lost will turn up in the south. You will only get half of your normal crops and silkworms from gardening, but your animals will be better than usual. In court, you will win. Itâ€™s a good idea to move. The sick will get better, and the graves of the dead will be blessed.
