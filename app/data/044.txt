Guan Yin Lot 44
Medium

Lot Verse:
The champion faces a worthy opponent as diamond slices diamond. 

It’s difficult to predict who will win. 

Each move is critical, and each play is crucial, 

Therefore avoid impulsive and dumb actions.

The Meaning:
This lot displays two diamonds placed against one other, as if they were playing chess against each other. The winner will be determined by his wit, caution, and strategy. Consult a fortune teller to determine your odds. Your destiny is determined by the next move you make, much as in a chess game. 

Celestial Message:
Your family and you will be solid and secure. Business transactions will go your way, and you will achieve your financial goals. Marriage plans will not be finalized. A daughter will be born. Farming and the silkworm business will be ok, but you’ll lose a lot of cattle. Travelers and visitors will be delayed. All attempts to relive vanished moments would be futile. You should make compromises and resolve litigation peacefully. Only by appealing to God for compassion will sick people be healed. Changing your ancestors’ graves is not advised.
