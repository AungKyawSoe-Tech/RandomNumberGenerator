Guan Yin Lot 23
Medium

Lot Verse:
Climb the laurel tree to reach the moon. 

Alas! Heaven is locked. 

Good news will quickly spread.

Everyone will smile then.

The Meaning:
Trying to take a branch from a magical laurel tree.  You will get help from well-known people when you need it in all situations.

There will be profits from trade, but there may also be risks.  Your case will win, and the sick will get better.  If you try your best, you’ll be fine.

Celestial Message:
The safety of your family is unclear, but you can be sure of your own safety by praying. There will be business deals made. This year is good for making money. Your wedding will be pushed back, and your wife won’t get pregnant until you pray to God. All farming businesses end up losing money, whether they deal with silkworms, food, horses, or household animals. There are risks for travelers, and those who go missing can’t be found. It’s not a good idea to move. Only the graves of very old people will be safe.
