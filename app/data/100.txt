Guan Yin Lot 100
Bad

Lot Verse:
The Gods and Buddhas have told you of changes to come,

Pay no heed to what the foolish said.

As the aged drew this divine Lot,

Better to leave things as they are and wait.

The Meaning:
This lot tells you to do nothing and wait for things to turn out in your favor. Since this is the last special lot, you don’t have any other options. You should know one very important thing. You are in a very bad position right now, and the only way to get out of it is to pray to God and ask for his help.

Celestial Message:
The Oracle is finished with this Lot’s addition.  The situation is not looking good.  If you pay attention to what the Goddess has to say, you can obtain heavenly protection.
