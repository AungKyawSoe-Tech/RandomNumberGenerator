Guan Yin Lot 37
Medium

Lot Verse:
Don’t you dare go out in the sun without anything on. 

The wind barely makes the flame of the candle flutter. 

It’s best to give up and move to a faraway place. 

Follow the life of a hermit and you’ll find peace and happiness.

The Meaning:
A lit flame flickers in the wind in a dangerous way. You should get out of a bad situation, stay away from danger, and live a safe and happy life. Go somewhere quiet and out of the way. You should do nothing except wait. Your only way to protect yourself from danger and harm is to stay still. 

Celestial Message:
Keeping your current home the same will keep you safe. It will be hard to make business deals, but you should make money in the end. The marriage won’t work, and the only way to save the pregnancy is to pray. In the fall, you should harvest your grain crops and silkworms. Cattle won’t get hurt. You will get texts from visitors and hints about where the lost people might be. Disputes will be solved without violence. It is not a good idea to move or migrate. You will have to pray for those who are sick. Any change to the graves of ancestors would be a bad idea.
