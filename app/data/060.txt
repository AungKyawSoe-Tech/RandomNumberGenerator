Guan Yin Lot 60
Bad

Lot Verse:
A fire burns hotter with fuel, 

And the blazing flames spread over, sparing nothing.

Why not just forget about wealth and fame?

The Meaning:
Someone holding a bundle of firewood rushes to a burning home in an attempt to extinguish the flames. You need to prepare yourself in case you end yourself in a potentially risky scenario.

Celestial Message:
You must pray for the protection of your family as well as for yourself. Profitability is unlikely, and the company will suffer. Marriage plans will not be finalized. Even if you marry, your wifeâ€™s pregnancy will be hazardous. A guest will be delayed, and no sign of those who have vanished will be found. Farming and silkworm production will be unprofitable, and cattle will suffer as a result. You will lose in court because your case is unfair. A move is something to think about. Things lost may be discovered in the west. Danger threatens the ill. Ancestral burials are as normal.
