Guan Yin Lot 46
Medium

Lot Verse:
The advice is to remain still and make no changes. 

Take no action or make any new plans.

Be patient; someone will arrive shortly to assist you. 

A withering tree will bloom anew by then.

The Meaning:
The blossoming of a withering tree is an example of something done naturally. As a result, human effort is required. Better to remain silent and maintain the status quo with no change or activity. Any move will result in disaster.  

Celestial Message:
You are guaranteed protection for yourself and your family. Business transactions seem promising, but the moment is not right for a large profit. You should probably wait for your opportunity. The matchmaking process will be completed, and a daughter will be born. You will only get half of your grain and silk crop, and raising cattle will not be lucrative. Your intended visitor may face problems on the way. There is no news concerning the missing, and there is no possibility of finding lost things. You could win if you go to court. It is not advisable to migrate or travel. Prayer has an important role in sickness recovery. But your ancestorsâ€™ graves are in luck.
