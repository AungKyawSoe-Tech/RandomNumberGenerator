Guan Yin Lot 64
Bad

Lot Verse:
A fish swimming in a pure blue pond 

Comes into a net that surrounds it.

It is clueless as it attempts valiantly to escape, 

But everything is futile in the end. 

The Meaning:
The net catches the fish. You have to be very careful not to get caught in a trap. 

Celestial Message:
Danger besets your home; you yourself are liable to sudden disaster. You won’t find money if you look for it, but business looks good. You can’t set up a marriage. There are some risks to being pregnant. The person you were hoping to see will be late. No sign of the lost person can be found. There is no way to avoid damage to grain and silk, and the outlook for animals is not good. You will lose if you go to court. Lost things will never be found again. You might think about going on a trip. The sick are in danger of dying. Some changes need to be made to protect the graves of ancestors.
