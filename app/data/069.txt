Guan Yin Lot 69
Medium

Lot Verse:
On a cold day, a plum tree on a hill.

Its leaves have dropped and its twigs have withered, yet it continues to stand.

When the warmth of Spring returns softly, its flowery grandeur will be restored.

The Meaning:
The plum tree is back to being known as the king of flowers, as it once was. You shouldnâ€™t give up, because things will work out for the best in the end. 

Celestial Message:
Your family and you will not be completely safe. You must have faith in God. If you want to get rich, you need to be careful. Few business opportunities exist. The wedding will be put off. The person who was supposed to come will be late, but the lost person will be found. Spring is a better time to get pregnant than fall. Grains, silk, and animals will all bring in money. You will get in trouble with the law. Only in the East can lost things be found and fixed. The sick are in danger, but they will live and get better. You should rebuild the graves of your ancestors.
