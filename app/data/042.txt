Guan Yin Lot 42
Good

Lot Verse:
Blessing comes from kings and queens. 

All awards were kept and no mistakes were made. 

So you have the love and favor of Heaven. 

Even though you are still on earth, you seem to be in heaven.

The Meaning:
This lot tells about a lucky man who gets gifts and favors from heaven. It’s a sign of good luck and success, of course. Don’t forget that god helped you and that you owe him something. So, if you want to show God how grateful you are, you should burn smoke day and night. 

Celestial Message:
Your family will be protected, but only in the cold can you be certain of your own. Business transactions are promising, yet you may not get wealthy. The matchmaking process will be completed, and the pregnancy will be completed. On your paddy fields, harmful insects such as worms and hairy caterpillars will feast. Livestock will not be harmed and will benefit you. The anticipated guest has arrived, and the lost will be located. All efforts to locate misplaced objects will be futile. Lawsuits will be successful. Do not consider migrating. The sick will recover. Ancestral graves are not harmed.
