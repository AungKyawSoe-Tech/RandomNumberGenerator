Celestial Message:
Everyone in your family will be safe. You can’t make a lot of money, and you need to be careful in business. The marriage will work out, and a boy will be born from the pregnancy. Travelers will send a message, and those who are gone will show up later. Farming and silkworms will do well, and animals won’t be in danger. You should try to settle cases out of court. It’s not a good idea to travel. Things that get lost will turn up. Only prayer can heal a sick person. Graves of ancestors are pretty safe.
