Lot Verse:
The mountain way was covered with dark clouds and fog.

As families get back together, the moon is again full.

If you wake up now from a deep, beautiful dream, 

You will be led to the steps of Heaven.

The Meaning:
This is an account of how flowers begin to bloom once again around the end of spring. Things will turn out better in the end, as luckier and more promising as they have been promised to be.

Celestial Message:
Your household is dealing with a challenging circumstance right now. You have a responsibility to look for yourself. Creating wealth requires a significant investment of time and energy. The prospects for business are positive. The marriage is successful around the end of the year. There will be a daughter born. The prospects for farming, rearing silkworms, and keeping animals are favorable. It is not always simple to locate missing people, and travelers run the risk of running into problems. You shouldn’t put too much stock in the possibility of getting back what you’ve lost. The outcome of a case is never definite. If you travel far enough, you could arrive in a new planet. There is a possibility of an extended illness. Converting ancestral burial grounds should be done.
