Guan Yin Lot 49
Medium

Lot Verse:
The winter is so cold that water freezes. 

So what’s the point of fame and honor? 

The best thing to do now is to see what happens. 

When things calm down, it will be your turn.

The Meaning:
This lot depicts how cold water turns into ice. It means that you will fail every time you try to do something you can’t do. Cold water freezes into solid ice, which then melts and turns back into water that flows. Changes like this are normal in the real world, and the same is true for people. Man suggests but god disposes. 

Celestial Message:
You don’t know what the future holds for your family, and you have to pray for your own safety. Problems come up in business, which makes it hard to make money. Marriage doesn’t work, and having a child is dangerous. You will lose money when you grow, sell silk, or raise animals. Your friend is going to be late. Lost things won’t be found no matter how hard people try. In order to settle a case, you have to give up something. It’s not a good idea to go abroad. People who are sick won’t get better, but their places will be blessed.
