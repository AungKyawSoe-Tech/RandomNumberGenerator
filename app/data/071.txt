Guan Yin Lot 71
Medium

Lot Verse:
Ride like a fast horse through all paths.

As a lady married to two husbands, 

Or as a bow with two arrows, 

One must try to bring all parties together.

The Meaning:
Because a single bow is equipped with two arrows in this situation, disagreement is unavoidable. The remedy is to reschedule the erroneous match.

Celestial Message:
Your family is in grave danger, and you yourself are embroiled in a controversy. Attempts to amass riches are futile, and commercial transactions result in loss. Reunion after a failed marriage is advised. Pregnancy may be unsuccessful at first, but not afterwards. You will give birth to a kid. Farming and silkworm harvests will thrive later in the year. Youâ€™ll lose money on cattle. Travelers will be delayed, but those who have gone missing will be discovered. Lawsuits are filed against you. The ill have no choice but to pray for healing. You must convert your ancestral tombs to assure their protection.
