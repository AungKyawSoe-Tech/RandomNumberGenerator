Guan Yin Lot 59
Medium

Lot Verse:
Someone hides in the tower, 

Which is surrounded by thorns and thistles.

Life’s length and shortness are decided by fate,

You may lose more than you gain.

The Meaning:
Like a drunk man who is not sober, it is best to stay still and wait for the right time to avoid anything bad happening or being blamed for it. Stay where you are and wait until things are better.

Celestial Message:
Your family will be safe if you pray for them. You have nothing to worry about. If you try to get rich, you will be successful. Business looks good. Plans for a wedding will not be set in stone. In time, the person you’re expecting will show up. You won’t find any information about the lost man. If you don’t pray for God’s help, you probably won’t get pregnant. Silkworm farming will only give you half a crop, but dealing in cattle will make you money. Your side will not win in court. The best thing to do is to move or migrate. There’s no chance of getting back what’s been lost. God’s blessings will help the sick get better. Graves of dead people will be safe.
