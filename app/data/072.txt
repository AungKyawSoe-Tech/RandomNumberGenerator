Guan Yin Lot 72
Medium

Lot Verse:
Keep bees for the honey they produce; 

The only danger comes from the bees’ tails.

There may be alternative methods to earn a livelihood, 

But they come with their own set of hidden thistles and thorns.

The Meaning:
 This describes the scenario of beekeeping for honey. It implies that money cannot be obtained easily but only through hard labour.

Celestial Message:
Unfavorable situations endanger your house and put you in risk. Money-making challenges arise, and trading is put on hold. Matchmaking will be a failure. There is a risk of miscarriage during pregnancy. Grain, silk, and cattle crops will be modest. The expected guest will be late, and the lost will be difficult to locate. You have a little probability of recovering what was lost. Lawsuits are not in your best interests, and moving is not a good idea. Only by erecting an altar to banish the demons can the ill be healed. Your ancestors’ tombs are decaying and in risk of collapsing.
