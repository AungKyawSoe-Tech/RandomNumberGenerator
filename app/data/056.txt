Guan Yin Lot 56
Medium

Lot Verse:
Small boating along the river,

On a cold, starry night, don’t disturb the wise.

Why seek step-by-step guidance?

Let flowers distract you?

The Meaning:
When you are in a small boat on a stream, people will help you get through. Spending time planning your plans to reach a goal will be a waste of time.  You should leave things alone for now and wait until things look good.

Celestial Message:
The year will go smoothly for you and your family. There are good chances of doing business and making money. Marriage will work out, and after you get married, your wife will give birth to a son. Soon, someone will stop by. Your horses will be hurt, but you should be able to grow and raise silkworms well. Those who are lost will be found. If you go to law school, you’ll do well. It is suggested that you move. Lost things will be found, and people who are sick will get better soon. For your own safety, you should fix up the tomb of your ancestors.
