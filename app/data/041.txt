Guan Yin Lot 41
Medium

Lot Verse:
You take in a lot of important words, 

But you thought the thief was your son.

Don’t want what you see right now.

Look back to see what you need to remember.

The Meaning:
This is a story about a guy who is duped into treating a robber as his own kid. It advises you to be wary of being duped by deception. A single blunder may haunt you for the rest of your life. Remember this piece of wisdom from GuanYin, and you will not be sorry for being sacrificed.

Celestial Message:
Your family seems to be in danger, despite the fact that you have nothing to be concerned about. It is difficult to organize commercial transactions; the moment is not ideal for creating a fortune. Marriage plans will not be completed. A boy will be born, but the mother will suffer much. Only half of your grain and silkworm crop will be ready for harvest, but you will earn handsomely from cattle. Both the expected visitor and the absent guest will come in due course. Lawsuits should be resolved amicably. Migration or shifting home opponents may not seem promising, but if you must go, you must pray for God’s protection. The sick will be healed via prayer. There is no reason to be concerned about your ancestors’ graves.
