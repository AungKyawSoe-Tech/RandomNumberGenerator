Guan Yin Lot 66
Bad

Lot Verse:
A worried rider driving a horse on a steep route, 

Trouble if they leave the unit.

Broken oars amid wild waves,

Darker days, wilted flowers, and snowfall begin.

The Meaning:
This scene shows a broken boat being swept along by a strong wind. Everything is so dangerous that you must stay on guard and take care.

Celestial Message:
Worries and doubts will be hard on your family. Disaster puts your own safety at risk. You will lose money and fail as a business owner. The marriage won’t last long, and being pregnant will be dangerous. The friend will be late, and you won’t hear anything about the person who has gone missing. Farming silkworms and raising animals will all cause damage and loss. You will lose in court. Don’t think about moving. If you are very sick, you must make an altar and pray to God to get rid of the devils.
