Guan Yin Lot 63
Medium

Lot Verse:
We lost a needle while we were last at sea, 

And we’re still at sea looking for it.

Even if we do discover the needle, 

It will be a waste of time and effort.

The Meaning:
This is about looking for a guide out at sea. Everything is a waste of time, and there is no way out.

Celestial Message:
Your family will have bad luck. You must take steps against accident. The business will make money. There won’t be a final decision on marriage issues. Your wife is not likely to be pregnant, and the person you were expecting to see will be late. Farming and having silkworms will both make you money, but you shouldn’t buy animals because it could get hurt or die. There is no way to find the lost. Arguments and fights should be solved by finding a middle ground. It is suggested that you move. Lost things are gone for good. The sick won’t get better. For now, graves of ancestors will be safe.
