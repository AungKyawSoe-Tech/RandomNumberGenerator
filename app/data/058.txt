Guan Yin Lot 58
Medium

Lot Verse:
You must remember this straight advice

Don’t try to make money in other ways on foreign land.

Stay where you are and do what you were hired to do, 

Because anything else will not work.

The Meaning: 
Stay where you are and keep an eye out for opportunities, as suggested by this. Opportunity will present itself if you’re patient and open to it.

Celestial Message:
Your family will still be there, but your own life may be at risk. There are good chances of selling and making money. Marriage talks won’t go smoothly, and your wife’s pregnancy could put her life in danger. The person who was supposed to come will be late. Only half of what you grow and make from silk will be sold, and you will lose money on your animals. The man who has been lost will be found. You should not go to the police because they will find you guilty. It’s not a good idea to move, so stay where you are. The sick should not be made better. You can’t get back what you’ve lost. It is very important that you make changes to the graves of your ancestors.
