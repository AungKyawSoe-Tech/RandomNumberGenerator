Guan Yin Lot 82
Medium

Lot Verse:
The fierce flames burned the sky, 

Leaving only one water-lily stalk.

It starts to bloom again, 

And it stays that way until the end.

The Meaning:
This part talks about the scene where the water lily escapes the fire. It shows that you can get to safety even when things are very dangerous.

Celestial Message:
our family is in danger, and you need to keep an eye on yourself. Your competitors are hurting your business, so nothing you do to get rich will work. There wonâ€™t be a final deal in the marriage talks. Your wife will be pregnant, but it could be dangerous for her to give birth. Your farming and silk output will suffer, and your animals will also be hurt. There will be problems for travelers, and those who went missing will be found in the west. The law is not on your side, and traveling is not either. Things that get lost in the south can be safe. Worship is the cure for those who are sick. To protect the graves of your ancestors, you must have them changed.
