Guan Yin Lot 26
Medium

Lot Verse:
The court personnel are the target of rumors. 

Heaven sends a wonderful message. 

Giving your name rank and distinction.

Alas! It turns out to be completely false and without foundation.

The Meaning:
This lot talks about how empty name and title are. They are empty and useless, just like show and human pride. So you should be more real and true to your own nature. As much as man cares about his name and rank, they are both fake. Why worry about your position and title? Better to just stand there and take care of your own business. 

Celestial Message:
If you ask for it, you and your family can be safe and sound. You will have trouble making money, though. Both business and love will fail. The baby will be a girl. Silkworms and grain will only give you half a harvest, but your cows will make you more money. Travelers will bring news, and those who are lost will be found. Things list is gone for good. In court, you will lose. Moving to a new place or migrating is not a good idea. Godâ€™s grace can heal those who are sick, so pray for them. Nothing bad will happen to the graves of your ancestors.
