Guan Yin Lot 73
Good

Lot Verse:
When a quick thunderclap wakes them up in the spring, 

Worms and beetles call out and jump out of the ground.

As the people coming and going add up, 

They turn into a dragon in one sweep.

The Meaning:
This is an explanation of how spring thunder wakes up all the sleeping worms and bugs. That’s a good sign.

Celestial Message:
You and your family have had a good year. You will probably have good luck in the spring, and people with power and influence will help you with your work. Your marriage will go well, and your wife will have a boy. Especially early in the year, the silk and food crops will be good. It’s also good for animals. People will come on time, and those who are missing will show up. In court, you will win. Travel goes well, but people who are sick will have trouble. There won’t be any trouble with the graves of the dead.
