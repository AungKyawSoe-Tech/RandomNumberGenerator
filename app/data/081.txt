Guan Yin Lot 81
Good

Lot Verse:
Phoenix leaves dropped 

As passengers returned home like clouds.

A treasure-laden ship cruises with fair breezes, 

Thankful for Heavenâ€™s bounty.

The Meaning:
The way leaves fall off of phoenix trees is a sign that things may look bad at first, but they will get better over time. 

Celestial Message:
You have to swear to give a gift to God in exchange for the safety of your family and yourself. In business deals, people have high hopes of making money. Even if a marriage works out, there are some risks that come with being pregnant. Late in the year, harvests from gardening and silkworms are good. Animals are stable and safe. The guest and the lost will both show up at some point. In court, you will win. There are no problems with traveling. You will be happy when the sick person gets better. For a good place to bury your ancestors, you should talk to an expert.
