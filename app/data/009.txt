Guan Yin Lot 09
Everything is at the Medium level.

Lot Verse:
Don’t give in to greed and hate; throw them away. 

Let morality be your only guide. 

Your heart will be open, clean, holy, and bright. 

Same as how the full moon shines brightly in the sky.

The Meaning:
This lot shows the sky lit up by a full moon. Hope shines brightly from every direction. Be as honest, fair, and even-handed as you can, and stick to the ideas of reason, justice, and kindness. No saint or wise person ever gives in to bad things. Light and dark can always be recognized.

Celestial Message:
Your family and you will have a good year. People can do business and trade and make money from it. The marriage will work out, and the baby will be a boy. Making silk and raising animals will make money, but household animals will get hurt. Someone leaves on a trip. Through prayer, things that were lost will be found. Cases in court will go your way. It is best to move. The sick will be made better. You don’t need to worry about the graves of your ancestors.
