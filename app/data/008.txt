Pines and cypresses do well and grow well. 

They can’t be hurt by rain, snow, wind, or frost. 

One day, the wood will show how valuable it is. 

You are like this wood, strong support for society.

The Meaning:
This lot shows a scene with a lot of cypress and pine trees. They reflect the happiness and worth of people. You will have a smooth and safe trip and do well in your work. There will be a lot of grain and silk. Your family’s reputation will continue to rise, and so will your wealth.

Celestial Message:
Your family will be safe, and you will have good work chances. You will have a happy marriage. Making silk and growing silkworms will bring in money, but raising cattle will cost money.

Moving is a good idea, and sickness will go away. The graves of your ancestors are safe and sound.
