Guan Yin Lot 04
Good sign for you.

Lot Verse: 
The shattered mirror is repaired 

The couple reunites.

From now on, a new house is provided

Giving their children greater wealth and delight.

The Meaning:
Broken pieces of a mirror can be put back together. All the work done to make up for past mistakes will pay off in the end. Sort through the sand to get to the gold. Take the dragon for a ride and step on the tiger. You will be praised for all your hard work

Celestial Message:
Your well-being is ensured but your family’s safety is not. Transactions in business will go well. Winter and fall are good times to make money. The chances of getting married are good, but the only way to get pregnant is to pray. Raising animals and silkworms will make money, but you should try to avoid cases. The man you’re waiting for will come. In the end, things that were lost will be found. Moving is not a good idea. Patients should pray to God to get better. Nothing bad will happen to the graves of their ancestors.
