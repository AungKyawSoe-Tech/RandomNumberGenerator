Guan Yin Lot 36
Medium

Lot Verse:
You’re sick and in court, so keep your cool.

There are resources and wealth waiting to be found. 

A brave monkey breaks free of a gold chain. 

Freely moving around in his mountain cave.

The Meaning:
A smart monkey gets out of a golden chain. It means that you can get through hard times if you work hard. Once you don’t have to worry about anything anymore, you can do anything. Men who are patient will get a lot in return. You have a clear path to success in front of you.

Celestial Message:
Your family isn’t sure what will happen, but you are safe. Even though the business deal will take longer, there is still money to be made. The chances of getting married are not good, and you need to pray for a safe delivery if you are pregnant. There will be a good crop of food, and it will also pay to raise silkworms and horses. The person you’re expecting to come is on their way, and even the ones you’ve lost will turn up again. Lost things can only be found a long way away. In a fight or disagreement, the law will be on your side. Migration looks good. It’s rare that a sick person will get better, but their graves will always be safe and lucky.
