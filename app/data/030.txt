Guan Yin Lot 30
Medium

Lot Verse:
The best advice is to not shoot too high. 

A stork in the air might hide an arrow. 

As you go through the fields to get the faggots, you might come across a snake. 

You’ll feel bad about that poison bite for a long time.

The Meaning:
This lot tells you to be happy with what you have and not set your sights too high. You must do everything you can to prepare for bad things that could happen. Keep your mouth as tight as a bottle that has been shut. Don’t join in, but don’t stay away either. If you do something that goes against your morals, you will end up hurting yourself in ways you can’t even imagine.

Celestial Message:
Your home will be safe enough, but you can’t be sure about your personal safety. Business is slow and will eventually stop. You probably won’t get rich, so it’s best to wait. The chances of getting married aren’t good, and getting pregnant won’t help. The outlook for raising herds isn’t good. Both travelers and tourists will have problems. Moving or migrating is not a good idea. Things that go missing are never found again. This illness can’t be fixed, but your ancestors’ graves won’t have any problems.
