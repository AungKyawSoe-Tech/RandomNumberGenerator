Guan Yin Lot 39
Bad

Lot Verse:
The message comes from a long way away. 

It is hard to understand and has no value. 

You can’t turn a stone into a mirror, 

So be smart and don’t waste your time or effort.

The Meaning:
This is a story about how you can’t make a stone into a mirror. You shouldn’t be so stupid as to try to do something you can’t do. You have to be happy with the way things are and let them stay that way. Even if you have a thousand goals, they will all fail, so the main rule should be to be patient and happy.

Celestial Message:
Even though no one in your family is in danger, you still need to take care of yourself. Even if things go wrong in your business, you will have a good chance of getting rich. Arrangements for marriage don’t work out well. Your wife will have a daughter. Farming and making money from silkworms are both profitable, but having cattle is not. Your expected guest has already left, but the lost person can’t be found. Lost things can never be found again. Neither lawsuits nor movement are good signs. You should pray at the altar to get rid of the devils for the sake of the sick. Nothing bad ever happens at the graves of your ancestors.
