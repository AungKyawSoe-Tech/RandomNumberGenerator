Guan Yin Lot 10
This is a Neutral sign for you.

Lot Verse:
A jade and jewel treasure awaits. 

Why seek abroad for unknown gold. 

Like the lamp-bearer looking for fire. 

Get home and pack.

The Meaning:
Even though he has a lamp, the man is still looking for fire. You should wait for your chances and be patient. Soon, you will be successful. Once your marriage is set up, you can’t change it. Be happy with what you’ve got. Don’t waste your time on dreams that can’t come true. What you see right now is real and true.

Celestial Message:
The future looks bad for your family, but not for you. You will have trouble making money and running a business. It’s fine to get married, and a girl will be born. In the fall, farming and making silk will bring in money. This is a bad year for animals that live in homes. The person you were hoping to see has already left, and the lost will be found. This has nothing to do with what you’ve lost. People will sue you and win. Moving is not a good idea. You can treat diseases. The graves of your ancestors will be safe.
