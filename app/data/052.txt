Guan Yin Lot 52
Medium

Lot Verse:
Trying to pull the moon out of the water,

All of that hard work for nothing.

Avoid idle chatter and false rumors,

That exhausts the spirit and reinforces isolation.

The Meaning:
Trying to satisfy your greed is a waste of time, and all your efforts will be for nothing. 

Empty words don’t mean anything, waste your time, and tire out your mind. There is sadness and worry in your home. Please wait for your distinguished patron to arrive.

Celestial Message:
Your family will go through a hard and sad time. You are also a danger to yourself. There aren’t many chances to make money, and running a business is hard. Prayer is the only way to end a marriage or make a baby safe. Travelers will get into trouble. Half as much silk and grain will be grown, and the number of horses will go down. This person will come back. Cases should be solved outside of court by making a deal. It’s not a good idea to travel. This sick person needs to pray to get better, but your graves won’t be a problem.
