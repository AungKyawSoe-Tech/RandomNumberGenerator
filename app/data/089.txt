Guan Yin Lot 89
Good

Lot Verse:
Things are going well with plans and projects.

Like rare jade hidden in a stone, 

If you follow a rich and powerful man, 

You will get jewels and other valuable things.

The Meaning:
Just as the scene talks about gems that are hidden under a stone, you should be happy with the good luck that is coming your way.

Celestial Message:
You and your family will be safe, and you will feel good. Your business grows well, and your dreams of getting rich will come true. The marriage will work out, and a boy will be born. Farming and making silk will bring in a lot of money. If you work hard, your animals will do well. The person you were expecting has already left, and the lost person will be found at some point. Lost things will come back. You will win your court cases. It is suggested that you move. The sick will get better, and the graves of your ancestors will be left alone.
