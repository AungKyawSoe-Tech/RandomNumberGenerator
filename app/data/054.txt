Guan Yin Lot 54
Bad

Lot Verse:
When you wake up, the treasures you saw in your dream are gone.

A lifetime as long as the southern mountains might equate to a lifetime spent working the hoe.

When it comes to health and marriage,

Find support and help somewhere else.

The Meaning:
Like trying to find treasures in a dream, your work will be for nothing. Images of objects in the water are distorted and vary depending on where one looks. Everything is predetermined; you cannot argue or bargain with the Heavens.

Celestial Message:
Family safety is uncertain. Prevent risk. Wealth and business will be difficult. Marriage fails. Farming, cattle, and silkworm rearing are not ready. Pray throughout pregnancy. The lost visitor will return. Youâ€™ll lose in court. Relocating is advised. Finding missing items will fail. Praying heals. Bless ancestral graves.
