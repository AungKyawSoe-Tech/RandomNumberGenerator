Guan Yin Lot 40
Medium

Lot Verse:
 The moon will come up when the sun goes down. 

The power of the moon grows, while the power of the sun decreases. 

If it’s a woman who wants to get rich, 

She’ll be happy all year long.

The Meaning:
 This is about how the moon covers the sun. The idea is that once problems are solved, moving forward becomes easy. Because the moon’s power is rising, the blessing will go to the woman and not to the man. At first, your dreams won’t come true, but in the end, they will. 

Celestial Message:
Your family is in a bad situation, but god is in charge of keeping you safe. Making money isn’t looking good right now, but things will get better in the future. No marriages will be made, and your wife won’t get pregnant. But your animals, silkworms, and food will do well this year. Your friend and the lost person will both have problems. Lost things can’t be found because there are no hints about where they might be. Migration or changing where you live is advised. The sick will have to go through a lot of pain, but they will finally get better. Your ancestors’ graves have no worries.
