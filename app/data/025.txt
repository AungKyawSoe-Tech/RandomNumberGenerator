Guan Yin Lot 25
Medium

Lot Verse:
 Dangerous times are over. 

Revived plans succeed. 

Broad minds create successful plans. 

Patrons will reward talent.

The Meaning:
 This lot tells the story of an old well being filled with water from a spring. Nobles and leaders will support whatever you do and help you make your plans come true. Your problems will be fixed at last. People are no longer sick, and a time of happiness has begun. Just like a well gets new water from a spring, you will get through the problems you face.

Celestial Message:
Your family has a good chance. In your quest for fame and money, you will run into problems. Still, marriage works, but being pregnant is risky. Grain and silkworm crops won’t make any money, and neither will raising animals. People who travel or visit often run into problems, and things that are lost are often not found again. Your side wins in court. It is not a good idea to move or migrate. The only way to get better is to ask God for help. Your ancestors’ graves will have bad luck.
