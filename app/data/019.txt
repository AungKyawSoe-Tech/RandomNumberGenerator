Guan Yin Lot Divination 19 (Kuan Yin Lot 19)
Medium

Lot Verse:
In the Gorges, a ferry returns home. 

Why do the wind and waves rage? 

No stability or tranquility. 

Let the furious waves calm down. 

The Meaning:
 Rapids move a boat along as it rocks back and forth. You have to be patient and wait until the right time. When the situation is dangerous, like when the boat is going through waves, nothing can be done. But when the time is right, take it and move forward. 

Celestial Message:
You must pray to God for your family’s safety as well as your own. The business outlook is not good, and marriage plans won’t work out well. There’s fear during pregnancy. Grains and silkworms will give you a good crop, but you will lose some household animals. The visitor will come, but it is very hard to find the lost. Lost items will never come back. Cases will be solved peacefully. Moving is not advised. The sick can only get better by praying. No harm will come to the graves of ancestors.
