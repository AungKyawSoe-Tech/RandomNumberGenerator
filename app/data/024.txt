Guan Yin Lot 24
Bad

Lot Verse:
Unreasonable fights break apart your household. 

Like dead flowers on a limitless ocean. 

Grace doesn’t help idiots. 

A mess remains.

The Meaning:
A fool is stuck in the scene and can’t find a way out. In that case, you have no choice but to deal with your problems. Tolerance can do great things. Don’t talk about other people or spread rumors; keep an eye on everything. Try to work hard, be honest, and make friends as much as you can. By doing this, you may be able to avoid trouble. 

Celestial Message:
Your family and you will both be in danger. You can’t do business or make money. The chances of getting married are not good, so everyone has to wait. Prayer is the only way to get pregnant. Grains, silkworms, and animals kept as pets will all get sick, die, or be hurt in other ways. Visitors will have to wait, and people who are lost won’t be found. It’s hard to find things that have been lost. In court, you will lose. This is a good year to move. The sick person is in danger, so please ask God for help right away. Your ancestors’ graves will bring you bad luck.
