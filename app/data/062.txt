Guan Yin Lot 62
Medium

Lot Verse:
Chants Buddha’s words in the morning and evening. 

With his help, we can face any risks but avoid them all.

Getting help and advice from a well-known friend will bring you money and cash.

The Meaning:
 This describes what it looked like when Buddha was being helped from behind a screen. You don’t have to think about anything. All you have to do is wait, and money will come to you.

Celestial Message:
Your family and you will be safe. Things will go well with business, and luck will be found in the west. Marriage plans will work out, but a safe baby will only happen with God’s help. People on the road will have trouble, and the lost will be found in the west. Grain and silk crops will only produce 70% of what they should, but animals will make a record amount of money. People will sue you and win. It’s not a good idea to move so that you can stay where you are. Through God’s kindness, lost things will be found and sick people will get better. The graves of the dead are still in good shape.
