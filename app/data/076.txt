Guan Yin Lot 76

Lot Verse:
A fish? A dragon? Even though they look different, they are the same. 

They wait patiently in deep water for their luck to change.

One day, all of a sudden, 

One raises its head and jumps over the Dragon Gate.

The Meaning:
This is a fable about a fish and a dragon who hide in the water and wait for something good to happen.

Celestial Message:
Your family is safe, and you feel good and are in good shape. You have a chance of getting rich, but investing is not looking good right now. It will take time to make a final deal on marriage plans. Your wife is going to have a boy. Silk and food crops will be late, but there will be a lot of them. In the same way, poultry doesn’t look good at first, but it will make money in the long run. The person you are expecting will be late, and no one has heard anything about the lost person. Cases that aren’t settled will drag on for a long time. It’s not a good idea to move, so stay where you are. Sickness will last for a long time. Graves of your ancestors will bring you luck and money.
