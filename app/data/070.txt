Guan Yin Lot 70
Bad

Lot Verse:
Working like a busy bee, 

Flying from blossom to bloom, day after day.

When Spring fades and the flowers fade, 

You have nowhere to go except your heart and your feet.

The Meaning:
Just like busy bees have to keep doing their job of getting food from flowers, you have to work hard every day to make a living.

Celestial Message:
 Your family will be linked to rumors and scandals, and bad people are making plans to hurt you. You won’t make money, and you’ll also lose a lot of money. In business deals, there are always changes and unknowns. The marriage won’t last long, and there won’t be any kids. No one will hear from the tourists, and any efforts to find them will be for nothing. Grain, silk, and animals will all be hurt. There is no way you could win in court. The treatment won’t help the sick person. You shouldn’t move to a new place. You are pushed to have the graves of your ancestors rebuilt.
