Guan Yin Lot 88
Medium

Lot Verse:
A wooden tiger is standing at the gate. 

It looks scary, but it won’t hurt anyone.

Obviously, there is no threat. 

Worries, fears, and assumptions are all baseless.

The Meaning:
The wooden tiger looks and acts in a way that gives the wrong idea.

Celestial Message:
You won’t have peace at home, and you might even get caught up in problems. Be careful of mean and evil competitors who might ruin your plans to get ahead. Neither your business nor your marriage will work out, and your pregnancy will be pointless and dangerous. Grains, silk, and animals will all be hurt or lost. Visitors are running late, and no one knows anything about the lost. In court, you will lose. It’s not a good idea to travel. It is pointless to try to get back things that have already been lost. The sick should make a special gift to god, the white tiger, who is in charge of bad things happening. The situation is not good for the graves of ancestors.
