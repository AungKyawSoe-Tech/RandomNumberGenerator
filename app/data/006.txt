Guan Yin Lot 06
Neutral sign, sharing properties is good.

Lot Verse:
Live in the cave with birds. 

Be happy and not jealous. 

Each guy can support himself. 

None can traverse the planet.

The Meaning:
Living in a cave with a big condor. If you live your life according to your fate, good luck will come your way. Food will be plenty, though there wonâ€™t be much extra.  Life is poor and simple, but happy.  Be patient and enjoy what you have. Share your money and power with others.

Celestial Message:
The outlook is not good for both home life and getting money. It is possible to get married, and the pregnancy will be safe. You should start farming and making silk early, and you may lose some horses. Soon, a guest will come, and the man who has been lost will show up again. Things that get lost will turn up. Patients need care right away, but nothing will happen to the graves of their ancestors.
