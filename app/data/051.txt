Guan Yin Lot 51
Good

Lot Verse:
Summer days are long and hot, 

And many people worry about how hot it gets.

Heaven and Earth also know what people want, 

So they send a cool wind from the south.

The Meaning:
Everybody feels the heat in the fall.  Your plans will go the way you want them to.

Don’t be afraid to move on.  It’s time to make plans and projects, but be careful and don’t do anything reckless.

Celestial Message:
The lesson says that you don’t need to worry about your family, but you do need to worry about your own safety. If you want to make money, you will have good luck in the fall, but there is nothing particularly lucky about trade or business. Marriage works out, and the pregnancy leads to the birth of a boy. The person you were expecting to come has already left. You will lose a lot of money if you try to farm, and having silkworms or horses is not a good idea. Those who are lost will be found. You are likely to win in court. It’s not a good idea to travel. The north is where you’ll find anything you’ve lost. To pray for the sick to get better, you must make a promise to God. Good luck, and don’t hurt the graves of your ancestors.
