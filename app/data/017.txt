Guan Yin Lot Divination 17 (Kuan Yin Lot 17)
Medium

Lot Verse:
Don’t listen to scandals and rumors. 

Just say the prayers to Buddha all day and night. 

If you believe the lies and mean things people say, 

You’re eating meals of dreams.

The Meaning:
 This lot comes from a Chinese saying about a man who draws a cake to stop being hungry. It is useless and pointless. It is pointless to pray if your heart is full of unhappiness and other things to do. You draw a cake to get rid of your hunger, but it won’t work.

Celestial Message:
For the safety of your home, all you can do is pray to God. Everything will go well with your safety and your work. It will be hard to get married, but it will be safe to get pregnant. You will be better off if you start growing and raising silkworms as soon as possible. It won’t be worth it to breed household animals. The guest will show up late. This man will be found, but the things he lost can’t be found again. Cases will be solved in a friendly way. Sickness can only be helped by God. All is well with family graves.
