Guan Yin Lot 22
Medium

Lot Verse:
Drought kills paddy field stems. 

Thankfully, a strong rain arrives. 

Water grass, flowers, and fruit. 

Timely rain is gold.

The Meaning:
This lot talks about rain coming after a long time without it. When you’re in trouble, someone will always come to your aid. You’ll get a better harvest of grain and silk because luck is on the way. Treatment is already set up for those who are sick. The visitor will come back sooner than you think. 

Celestial Message:
Your family and you will be safe. There are good business chances, but deals can only be made at the end of the year. The plans for your marriage are good, and you will have a girl. Growing crops on the land and taking care of silkworms and animals will all make money. The visitor will be late, and the person who has gone missing won’t be found. Things that have been lost will be in the west. You will lose in court, and you shouldn’t migrate or move your house. Set up an altar for the sick to get rid of demons. There will be no damage to the tombs of ancestors.
