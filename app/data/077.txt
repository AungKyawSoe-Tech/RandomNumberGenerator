Guan Yin Lot 77
Medium

Lot Verse:
You dream of having a lot of money,

What does a name mean if it’s just a word?

It’s hard to believe that things found beyond seas and mountains are real.

Only help from a customer will make you happy.

The Meaning:
Just like you can only get gifts in a dream, this lot tells you that claims that sound too good to be true probably are.

Celestial Message:
You can only make your home safe by praying, but you may also have problems. The business will not do well. You can’t agree on anything in marriage talks, and your pregnant wife won’t give you a child. You won’t get a good crop of grain or silk, and your animals will make you lose money. The visitor will be late, and we haven’t heard anything new about the lost. You are told not to go to court but to work out your problems in other ways. Now is not the right time to move. You’re not likely to get back what you’ve lost. Set up an altar to keep the devils away so you can heal the sick. It is best to convert graves of ancestors.
