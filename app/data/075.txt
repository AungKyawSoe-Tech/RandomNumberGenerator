Guan Yin Lot 75
Medium

Lot Verse:
It’s like trying to pull a tiger up a mountain.

You are scared as you gather your courage.

You don’t know it, but good luck finds you. 

You make it through safe and sound with a place to live.

The Meaning:
You will face danger and hard times, just like the man who climbed a high mountain with a tiger.

Celestial Message:
Your family is safe, but your own safety relies on God’s kindness. Making profit is rare so don’t take risks. Neither work nor marriage looks good. Your wife may be in danger both while she is pregnant and when she is giving birth. Only half of your silk and grain crop will come in. Even animals aren’t doing well this year. The visitor will have to wait, and no one has heard anything about the lost person. Lost things won’t be found, and if you get sued, you’ll lose. Prayer is the only thing that can help the sick. It is not a good idea to move. It is a very important time for the graves of your ancestors.
