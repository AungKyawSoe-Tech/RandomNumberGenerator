Guan Yin Lot 83
Medium

Lot Verse:
On the third, fourth, and fifth, 

There is a circle that is sometimes there and sometimes not.

Round and full, 

It lights up the sky until the night of the 15th.

The Meaning: 
This is about how the moon looks when it looks like a circle. It shows that things that seem dangerous at first don’t always turn out to be that way in the end.

Celestial Message:
God is watching over your family, so you must promise to do what you are told. There will be chances for you to make money in the summer and fall. For trade to grow, it’s best to wait and keep an eye out. It takes time for a marriage to work. A girl is born when a woman is pregnant. Silkworms, food crops, and animals will all be fine. The visitor will be late, and it won’t be as easy as you think to find the lost person. Lost things won’t be found. Mediation should be used to settle disagreements. Changing where you live is not a good idea. To get rid of the demons that are making people sick, a special altar should be built. Graves of ancestors should be changed.
