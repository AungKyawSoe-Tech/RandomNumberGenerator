Guan Yin Lot Divination 20 (Kuan Yin Lot 20)
Medium

Lot Verse:
As the weather clears after a rainy spell,

Now you can see the Golden Crow and the Jade Rabbit.

As the old fades, the new appears.

It only takes one jump to clear the Dragon Gate.

The Meaning:
This lot talks about how the sky gets brighter after a long rain. This phrase means that everything will work out well. No one will get hurt as long as gods and Buddhas look out for them. No matter what the situation is. Once your long-held dream comes true, your return home will be a wonderful one.

Celestial Message:
Your home will be pretty safe, but you should pray for your own safety. It wonâ€™t be a good year for making money and doing business. Waiting is the only option. You can get married, and you will have a little girl. Your silkworms, grain crops, and animals at home will all have bad luck. When you have a disagreement, you should find a way to settle it without going to court. The chances of moving and starting over are good. Travelers have problems along the way, and those who have gone missing will show up late. Things that get lost will turn up. You can get better if you pray to God to get rid of the disease. Graves of ancestors will stay safe and sound.
