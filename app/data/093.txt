Guan Yin Lot 93
Medium

Lot Verse:
Even simple birds chuckle at the phoenix’s rain-soaked feathers.

After the rain stops, 

Its plumage remains majestic.

The Meaning:
This image illustrates the fabled phoenix’s feathers getting wet in rain. It advises you that in times of adversity, you must accept any humiliations placed on you. Honor and glory will be restored as soon as the rainy days are through. 

Celestial Message:
Your family does not look to be secure, and you must take precautions to protect yourself. Business transactions are not feasible, and making a profit is difficult. Marriage must be rescheduled. Pregnancy is pointless. Grain and silk harvests will be lower than planned, and animals will be lost. Travelers will loiter on their trip, with little prospect of discovering the missing. Lawsuits will be filed against you. Any change in residence will be ineffective. The illness persists. Ancestral tombs should be rebuilt as quickly as possible.
