Guan Yin Lot Divination 15 (Kuan Yin Lot 15)
Medium

Lot Verse:
The hot sun is making the man on foot crazy. 

You are caught off guard by a natural disaster.

As if the bird’s nest had fallen. 

Only deep in the forest will you find a place to hide.

The Meaning:
 You will face hardship and difficulties at first, like a bird finds a nesting location in the forest, but all your worries will be resolved in the end. When will you exact your vengeance if you have been wronged? Tolerance is your only option since beautiful words irritate the ear. There is no reason to be afraid.

Celestial Message:
Things look bad for your family right now, but they will get better in the future. Take safety measures to protect yourself. Trade will go well, and money will start to pile up. You won’t be getting married, but you will have a son. You can make money by farming, raising silkworms, and breeding pets. A tourist will get to their destination safely, and the lost will also show up. Lost things won’t be found. Your side will win in court. Your prayers will be answered, and the sick person will get better. Nothing bad will happen to the graves of the dead.
