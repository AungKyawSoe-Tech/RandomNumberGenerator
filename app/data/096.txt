Guan Yin Lot 96
Good

Lot Verse:
The towering pagoda is more than just an everyday building. 

It shines beautifully in every direction.

Make up your mind to worship and do more good things, 

Heaven will give you money in return for your kindness.

The Meaning:
A nobleman will be richly rewarded with the blessing of God. You will be blessed with wealth and luck if you purchase this lot.

Celestial Message:
You must make a promise and pray to God for your and your familyâ€™s protection. Everything is going your way in business. You will triumph in your quest for money and prosperity. Your relationship with your wife continues positively after marriage, and you will be overjoyed when your kid is born. Farming and breeding silkworms go easily, but livestock yields little return. The expected guest has indicated that he would come shortly, and the lost will resurface. Legal disagreements should be resolved outside of court. This is a good year for moving. You must resort to prayer to heal from illness. Ancestral graves have been left alone.
