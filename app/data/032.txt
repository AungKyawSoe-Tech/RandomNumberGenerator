Guan Yin Lot 32
Medium

Lot Verse:
Your journey is long, and you don’t know where you’ll go. 

Who can say for sure that the rock is hiding a piece of jade? 

One day, the skill of the person who made it will bring it out. 

You, the happy owner, have a valuable gem.

The Meaning:
Inside a stone, a piece of jade is found. This means that you can only be successful if you keep trying. A valuable jade is housed inside a rock. People might laugh at such a thought. It might be shown by how well a skilled builder does his job. But once that happens, you can do whatever you want.

Celestial Message:
Your family and you will both have a good year. The business will fail, and all attempts to make money will be for nothing. There’s no problem with getting married, but your wife won’t have any kids. The harvests of silk and grain will be good but late. If you raise horses, you will make a good amount of money. The guest says nothing else, but the lost will be found. Things that were lost will show up in the west. At first, lawsuits will go against you, but they will end up in your favor in the end. If you are thinking about moving, change where you want to go. People who are sick will have long-term problems, but the graves of the dead will be safe.
