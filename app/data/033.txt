Guan Yin Lot 33
Medium

Lot Verse:
You don’t know that valuable things are close to you, 

So you look around and around in vain. 

Just chill out and wait for the man. 

Because he knows where the treasure is.

The Meaning:
 A guy is hunting for golf without realizing a piece of jade is hidden in a nearby rock. You must be patient and await an opportune period. You seek everywhere for gold and jade but come up empty-handed. Fortune will come to your help, and you will obtain what you are due.

Celestial Message:
Praying for divine intervention can benefit your loved ones, but you yourself have nothing to fear. It’s not the time to try to make a lot of money or close any important business transactions. The couple will have a happy marriage and have a son. Cattle raising will be lucrative, but farming and the silk business will not. The search for the missing will be difficult, and travelers will be delayed. Lost-and-found searches are a waste of time. Your lawsuits will be dismissed. Moving or migrating is a good idea. These patients will recover. It’s wise to relocate your ancestors’ graves.
