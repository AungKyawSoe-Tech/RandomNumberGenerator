Guan Yin Lot Divination 13 (Kuan Yin Lot 13)
Medium

Lot Verse:
You came from a noble family

Your life will be full of show and circumstance. 

You will get a golden cloak from the king. 

Your greatness and fame will never go away.

The Meaning:
The golden gate is at the end of every road. Everything is moving, but it all works out for your good. The sick will get better and prisoners will be set free. Once you reach the golden gate, everyone in the royal city will know your name, and it won’t be forgotten.

Celestial Message:
Pray for yourself and your family’s safety. You can’t get rich until fall or winter, and business deals will be better then. Your marriage will go well, and a girl will be born. Farming, growing horses, and silkworms will be pretty good. Pray for the safety of visitors. The missing man will be found, and things that were lost will be found in the east. Cases will go in your favor. Migration or moving your home is not a good idea. The sick will get better after care, and the graves of the dead will be blessed.
