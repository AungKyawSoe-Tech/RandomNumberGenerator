Guan Yin Lot 97
Medium

Lot Verse:
When a light is lit and the wind blows, 

Its shadows look like a bed of flowers in the mirror.

The child is confused and wants to keep the flowers, 

Only to find out that they are not real.

The Meaning:
The image depicts a candle being lit in the wind. It is foolish to pursue an empty title with no tangible reward.

Celestial Message:
You must pray for Godâ€™s protection to safeguard the safety of your family. You will be fortunate in collecting money, but you must use caution in commercial operations. Marriage is conceivable, but it will not be particularly nice or awful. Both the pregnant woman and her unborn child are in danger. Livestock, cereals, and silkworms will all suffer. There has been no communication from the expected guest, nor has there been any news of the missing. Lawsuits will be detrimental to you. Moving is not recommended. There is no way to reclaim what was gone. The ill are being exploited by the demons of the underworld. Ancestral graves should be rebuilt.
