Guan Yin Lot 55
Medium

Lot Verse:
A good father instills virtue in his children.

Heaven will provide for all of their wants and needs.

Hunger is appeased, thirst is slaked, and the weary may rest.

The family’s older members are happy and content.

The Meaning:
Put the bamboo in a way that leads to a stream.  What you hope for will happen by chance. This will last for years, like bamboo sticks set up to lead to a spring.  No matter what a good man does, he will find great joy and happiness in it.

Celestial Message:
You must make sacrifices to God when you and your family are safe. You might make money from business deals. Everything that has to do with marriage will end well. The person who was supposed to come has already left. It will be hard to find the lost. A baby will be born in a safe way. Farming and raising silkworms will make you money, but your horses could get hurt. When you are being sued, a powerful and influential man will come to your aid. It’s good to travel, and things you lose will turn up again. Setting up an altar to get rid of demons is a good idea for people who are sick. The graves of your ancestors will be left alone.
