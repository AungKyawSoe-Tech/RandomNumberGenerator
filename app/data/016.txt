Guan Yin Lot Divination 16 (Kuan Yin Lot 16)
Medium

Lot Verse:
Don’t put on a sad face with downcast eyes. 

Put all worries away and think about happiness.

 In a pile of poop, someone finds a piece of jade. 

When the artist cleans the jade, it looks as good as new.

The Meaning:
 This lot shows yin-yang harmony. (Note: In the Chinese Book of Changes, “yin” signifies “female principle,” “moon,” “shade,” and “negative,” whereas “yang” means “male principle,” “sun,” “light,” and “positive”). Your ideas will succeed when the two principles are in harmony, like this lot. Gains and losses will be paid. Virtuous people get lucky, while villains are punished. 

Celestial Message:
It’s not a good year for the safety of your home, but you won’t get hurt except in the fall and winter. Both making money and getting married will go well. A mother-to-be will be taken by surprise. You must pray for your horses and silkworms, but your household animals will be fine. The visitor will show up on time, and those who have gone missing will be found. You won’t find any hints about where the lost things are. You are told not to go to law school and not to move. People who are sick need to pray to God. Nothing bad will happen to the graves of the dead.
