Guan Yin Lot Divination 14 (Kuan Yin Lot 14)
Medium

Lot Verse:
The fairy crane escapes from its cage

So you can fly wherever you will.

No corner of heaven is barred on your flight.

Even to paradise or as far as you please. 

The Meaning:
 In this scene, a fairy crane gets out of its cage, which means that everything will turn out well. Everything is set up for you, and you can pick whatever you want. There’s no risk. You should take it easy, do things slowly, and never complain.

Celestial Message:
Your home isn’t safe, so it’s hard to feel at ease there. You should pray to God to keep yourself safe. Things look good for business right now. Your wife is going to have a boy child. In the fall, you might make money from gardening and the silk business, but your pets will get hurt. Soon, a guest who has been promised will show up. People will have to wait. You can find lost things in the southeast. In a case, it’s best to try to find a way to make peace. Moving is strongly suggested. If someone gets sick, the only way to make them feel better is to build an altar to scare the devils away. Nothing bad will happen to the graves of your ancestors.
