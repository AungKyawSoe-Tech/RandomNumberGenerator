Guan Yin Lot 02
Lot 02 is Bad, this is a sign to tell you to have to wait and stay calm down.

Lot Verse:
The carp are still silent in the river.

Don’t try to jump far or aim too high

Changes that are coming one day

Will jumps over the dragon’s gate. 

The Meaning:
This lot is about a young fish that is waiting calmly and with patience. In the same way, you have to put up with everything and be as patient as you can until the right time comes. You can keep your respect and good name this way.

Celestial Message:
Your family’s safety will be less certain than your own, though. Time is not good for making money or getting married. God decides who gets pregnant. If you want to move, you should consider going to the southeast. It’s not a good time to grow, raise cows, or make silkworms. A lawsuit should be solved peacefully, and someone who is sick needs God’s help. Your ancestors’ graves will always be happy.
