Bad

Lot Verse:
Virtuous people think differently from villains, 

Who exhibit their flaws.

Remain and calmly wait for the uncommon company.

You must be cautious about your personal safety, particularly when you leave the home. Because there is no opportunity of conducting business, generating money is very tough. Marriage will be postponed, and just one child will be born. Your grain and silkworm crops will be meager, and you will suffer significant animal losses. The anticipated guest has begun his trip. You can only locate what is lacking if you work really hard. Searching for misplaced items requires rapid action. In conflicts, seek compromise and arbitration rather than going to court. The illness will last longer. Your ancestorsâ€™ graves are in an unpleasant location.
