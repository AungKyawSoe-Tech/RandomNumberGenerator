Guan Yin Lot 98
Bad

Lot Verse:
Don’t rush to find your wealth. 

Haste can lead to trouble and mistakes.

Like a bird that fell into a net, 

It will take a long time to get out.

The Meaning:
This tells you to stay put amid terrible times. Any action might lead to disaster. Your family will face concerns, suspicions, and complaints.

Celestial Message:
You are surrounded by rogues and villains who are scheming against you. Transactions in business will fail. Marriages can not endure long and might end at any moment. Pregnancy may result in a court of law conviction. Farming, silkworm breeding, and cattle all suffer from a lack of time. Travelers are in danger, and there are no leads on the whereabouts of the missing. Things that are misplaced will never be found. You will lose in court. Do not change your address. This ill person is in dire danger, as though caught in a net. Worse, your ancestors’ tombs are in perilous condition.
